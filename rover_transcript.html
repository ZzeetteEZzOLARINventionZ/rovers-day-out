<P class=western>
  Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his dealer's hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of him, he's either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can't mass more than about 30 kilos, and he's been putting them away tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you'll get some sleep before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don't go....where is everyone going?

  The alarm clock rolls into a ball, and flies the length of the vehicle construction facility, chased by an eager, slobbering dalmation. In the Martian gravity, Rover bounds three meters into the air and sails over the heads of an annoyed crew in cleanroom suits working frantically on the Valkyrie's starboard Casimir Drive assembly. The mission director, David Venkatachalam, grimaces, but your mother offers you a comforting cup of tea.

Minimal resources are expended on each wake cycle, but if there were a problem during the approach, the ACU would elevate to full op status rapidly.</FONT>

  A pudgy puppy hastily rounds a corner, sliding awkwardly on the polished dormitory floor. Behind it, there are flashes of light, and a rolling cloud, a mixture of smoke and Martian atmosphere. As the above-ground structures are ripped apart and lose pressure, the shivering ball of white fur leaps into your arms, burying its snout in the fold of your elbow. The Earth missiles continue to pound the university, but cannot penetrate to this depth. Huddled under a sturdy desk, you pet the frightened dog and hug it tight.

He studied mathematics in New Delhi and Novosibirsk before working on theoretical aspects of the Casimir propulsion system at Myomita Corporation in Sapporo. He was cut off from Earth by the events preceding the Independence War, and after the war naturalized as a Martian Citizen, joining the Valkyrie program at MARSpace.

  The potential for interstellar commerce has been constrained by time and distance. Although Condensate Drive has allowed vessels to reach nearby stars, it is expensive and slow, and holds little promise for commercial exploitation. The Valkyrie is the first ship to incorporate Casimir Drive, giving it unprecedented speed and range. It is rumored that since the Valkyrie project fell into MARSpace hands after the Independence War, Earth's Myomita corporation has been working on a sister ship based on similar technology.

  Heavy helium is consumed as a fuel in fusion reactors, including the fusion rockets aboard the Valkyrie. Heavy helium is confined in a magnetic bottle, and the reaction is initiated by a flash of tightly concentrated laser energy. Subsequently, the reaction is self-sustaining.

  Casimir, or zero-point energy drive, was developed in the last ten years. By doing largely incomprehensible things to time/space, the Casimir Drive can translate a ship incredible distances in a fraction of the time and energy that would be required by a ship equipped with Condensate Drive. The one drawback to Casimir technology, at least in its current implementation, is that such trips are lethal to biological organisms, hence the need for the ACU.

  In 2108, shortly after the invention of Condensate Drive, the Myomita Corporation launched a number of deep space probes from their Martian Headquarters at Cydonia. More than thirty probes were launched, programmed to jump from system to system in search of planets with evidence of life. Refueling from the stellar wind in each system, the probes were designed to return only if successful. Three months ago, the Mushashi-5 transponder signal was detected, originating at a planet 38 light years from Earth. According to the telemetry, the probe was returning to the Solar System when it crashed. Both Mars and Earth have claimed ownership of the probe and the data it contains, and have mounted a program to retrieve the probe from where it crashed almost four decades ago.

  Your cottage’s living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter, with a toothbrush and some floss on it. A shallow sink is inset into the counter, and above it, you’ve mounted mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet. {initial description}You miss having a bath, but when you were selecting apartments only the high-rises had true baths. The garden apartments on the edge of the botanical facility all had these no-frills shower stalls.

  The image of Tomasz blinks momentarily as the relay is handed off from ground station to ground station, trying to keep line of sight to Phobos. Behind him, you can see the tubular structure of the power station jutting over the edge of Stickley Crater. He is taking the news rather well, all things considered. Tomasz guesses your thoughts as you glance at your diamond engagement ring. “Don’t sweat it,” he says. This whole rock is carbon, so plenty more where that came from.” There is blinding flash of light and the screen goes black.

<P class=western>
  A dwarf emerges from under the kitchen sink, spilling dog chow all over the floor. He throws you a menacing look, pries the fridge open with a black rod, and snatches an egg off the shelf. Sand pours out of the fridge. “Hey,” you yell from the futon, “put that back”. You stop short, realizing that this sort of distraction is exactly why you haven’t completed your dissertation. You feel around under the futon, where you think you will have put the dissertation so you could find it in the past, and grab the stubby snout of a pig. The fleet-footed porcine slaps a fish into its ear, jumps into a dumbwaiter and disappears.

  David Venkatachalam, age 42, citizen of Mars, and Project Leader for the Valkyrie program. David was raised in an undersea community just north of Sri Lanka, so he had less difficulty adapting to Mars and its life support requirements than most Earthers. He studied mathematics in New Delhi and Novosibirsk before working on theoretical aspects of the Casimir propulsion system at Myomita Corporation in Sapporo. He was cut off from Earth by the events preceding the Independence War, and after the war naturalized as a Martian Citizen, joining the Valkyrie program at MARSpace. David is single, attractive, and most importantly, he likes dogs.

  You are in the living room of a small cottage, actually more of a studio apartment. The principle furnishing is a king-size purple futon that takes up almost all the floor space. {Your heavy drapes seem to have been ripped from the walls, but there is no sign of them}. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The apartment's front door is closed.

  The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. The drawer under the range has swung open. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet. The door to the storage cabinet is open, and a bag of dog food is on the kitchen floor. In a corner where they won't get kicked accidentally, there are two white bowls on the floor.

  You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed because during landing the ship had been buffeted by particulate matter being torn away from the doomed planet by the immense gravity its star. In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no back-up ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

  Rover lowers a super-cooled tank of metallic heavy helium in the cargo bay, and you transfer it to the cryo unit. You allocate a reward token to Rover and tell him he is a good boy. He seems pleased with himself and backs into his transport alcove before switching to standby. After running a preflight check, you are sure you have enough helium to take off and that the fusion engine was not damaged in the landing. You tear away from the planet atop a fiery column of fusion flame, and plot a course to Mars. As soon as the ship is correctly oriented, you deploy the Casimir Drive.

  The Casimir Drive cuts out and space folds back around you. Before you can take bearings, two gunships flash past at relativistic velocities, slicing through your propulsion systems. The markings on the ships are those of the Myomita Corporation, and they must have been expecting you to emerge precisely where and when you did. Two more Earth ships, assault craft, are on an intercept course and are braking hard to slow their approach.

  Epilogue
</P>
<P class=western>
  <BR>
</P>
<P class=western>
  Subsequent to her heroic actions, Janet Xiang was commissioned Director of MARSpace. For two years, she oversaw the refitting of the Valkyrie, including modifications to overcome the earlier limitations of Casimir Drive. When the data from the Musashi-5 space probe were finally decrypted, she was selected to command the mission to explore the evidence of life discovered by the probe. She departed from Mars on the Valkyrie in 2394 with one other crewmember, her dog, Rover.
</P>
<P class=western>

<P class=western>
  {alternately, should Rover not attack….

<P class=western>
  <BR>
</P>
<P class=western>
  When the data finish transferring to David’s account, he blows Janet a kiss and then shoots her, twice in the chest and once in the head, just to be sure. “Thank you for your service to the Myomita Corporation,” he quips before activating a dormant subprogram hidden in your communications subsystem. You feel you control slipping away, as a virus spreads through your systems. As your cognitive systems shut down, you are aware that the new program has also set a timer to activate the ship’s Casimir Drive while in drydock.

  Mars was destroyed by a Casimir Inversion on June 5, 2392 and served as a warning to all other worlds that would dare defy Earth’s rule. Based on the data recovered from the Musashi probe, the Myomita Corporation launched a war fleet into Deep Space in 2394, intent on expanding its empire.

  * What is this?

<P class=western>
  * an adventure game

  Sure. Like you have no idea what this is...you just sat down at the computer and this somehow appeared. I'm not really buying it, but let's say that you were kidnapped and forced at gunpoint to play this game.

  At some point in the game, you might find it helpful to give your memory a gentle nudge by using the "REMEMBER" command. You aren't a walking encylopedia, and there are limits to your memory, but it may help put things in context for you or help you work out a sticky problem.

</P>
<P class=western>
  * status bar
</P>
<P class=western>
  By default, some key information in this game is displayed on the status line, but that may be a problem for some interpreters. If you would prefer that this information be displayed in the normal flow of text along with the rest of the game, type "status off". When you do so, the status bar, if visible, will display the current location and game turn number, as is common in games of this type. If you want to reactivate this game's special use of the status bar, you can revert to the original configuration by typing "status on".

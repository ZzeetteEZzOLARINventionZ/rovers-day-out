# Rover's Day Out

This game is a science-fiction text adventure (["interactive fiction"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)) originally written for the [IFComp 2009](http://www.ifcomp.org/) competition.  (And it won [1st place](http://www.ifcomp.org/comp09/results.html)!)

It's written in the [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) programming language, and compiles into bytecode that can be executed on a [Glulx virtual machine.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glulx)

(Because the source text straddles the fuzzy line between "code" and "fiction", we've released it on the Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - Share Alike 3.0 license.)

_If you've never played interactive fiction before_:  read this simple [crib sheet](http://www.microheaven.com/IFGuide/step3.html) to give you a sense of how the command parser works.  It's a limited vocabulary, fairly easy to master.

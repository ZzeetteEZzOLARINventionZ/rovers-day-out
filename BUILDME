What is this?
-------------

This is the source code to "Rover's Day Out", an interactive fiction
game (or more commonly known as "text adventure".)

It was originally written by Jack Welch (with assistance from Ben
Collins-Sussman) in summer of 2009, and was entered into the 2009
InfoComp competition and won 1st place.

The code is now released under the "Creative Commons Attribution - 
Noncommercial - Share Alike 3.0" license, which you can find in the LICENSE file.

The game is written in the Inform 7 language.  You can download the
compiler and IDE as a single package from here:

  http://www.inform-fiction.org

When compiled, the source code produces a bytecode file which can be
executed on any implementation of a Glulx virtual machine:

The game's source code lives in a single file called 'story.ni'.
However, it also depends on several Extension modules.


To build the game:
------------------

(These instructions are based on Inform release 6M62, early 2016)

1. Create a working Inform project from your source tree:

  $ git clone URL rover
  $ cd rover
  $ mv rover.inform/ moo.inform/

  [...launch Inform, create new project in this dir called 'rover'...]

  $ cp moo.inform/Source/story.ni rover.inform/Source/
  $ cp moo.inform/uuid.txt rover.inform/
  $ rm -rf moo.inform/


2. Copy the included .i7x files to wherever the Inform environment
expects to find extension modules:

  - on Mac, this is usually ~/Library/Inform/Extensions/.  On Windows
    or Linux, the location will be slightly different.  We'll let you
    figure it out.

  - create a directory called "Jon Ingold" in the Extensions
    directory, then copy 'Flexible Windows.i7x' into it.

  - create a directory called "Eric Eve" in the Extensions directory,
    then copy 'Adaptive Hints.i7x' into it.

  - create a directory called "Dannii Willis" in the Extensions directory,
    then copy both 'Alternative Startup Rules.i7x' and 'Glk object recovery.i7x'
    into it.

  - create a directory called "Emily Short" in the Extensions directory,
    then copy 'Glulx Entry Points.i7x' into it.




3. Launch the Inform IDE and load the rover.inform project.  The
source code should be visible, and it should compile fine.  Make sure
that Inform's settings are are set to "Glulx" as the target VM.
